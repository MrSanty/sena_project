## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication for Next.js applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **NextUI**: A React UI library for building modern web applications.
- **TanStack Query**: Powerful data fetching and state management for React.
- **Bun**: A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Project Structure

- **/actions**: API interaction logic (fetching and mutating data).
- **/app**: Contains all the Next.js page routes.
- **/components**: Reusable UI components.
- **/hooks**: Custom React hooks used throughout the project.
- **/interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces for typing the data models.
- **/lib**: Helper functions and third-party integrations.
- **/prisma**: Configuration for the Prisma ORM and database schema.
- **/public**: Static assets such as images and fonts.
- **/utils**: Utility functions for handling data transformations, formatting, etc.
- **/validations**: Functions and schemas used for validating data and forms.

## Authentication

This project uses **NextAuth.js** for authentication. The configuration is located in `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`. Ensure that environment variables related to authentication (like `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `SECRET`, etc.) are properly set.

## Styling

We use **Tailwind CSS** for styling the application. Global styles are defined in the `global.css` file, located in the `/app` folder. You can customize your design by modifying or adding new utility classes.

For more information, check the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## UI Components

**NextUI** is used for the UI component library. Refer to the [NextUI documentation](https://nextui.org/docs) for more details on customization and usage.

## Data Fetching

We leverage **TanStack Query** to handle all data fetching and synchronization logic. The API interaction functions are located in the `/actions` folder, where each function handles specific API calls and manages their respective states.

For more advanced usage, visit the [TanStack Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).
